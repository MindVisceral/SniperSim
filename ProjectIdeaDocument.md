## (3D) Static Sniper Simulator ##
Base idea: Player is holed up in a bunker, shooting at whatever is outside;
e.g. First out of boredom (the tutorial), later to protect themself (singular threats) (including variety over time), moving up to larger threats (machines? invaders? aliens? - depends on the final setting and story).
Setting: Could take place in The Usual. You already know what that means. That would allow for environment change over time.
The outside is bright and pleasant at first (including small targets/animals? to shoot) - to provide contrast between the comparatively grim bunker. Later, as the outside grows more hostile, the bunker becomes the more pleasant and safe place. There is some sort of a theme somewhere in here, look into it.

## Gameplay: ##
The game is separated into:

#The shooting part:#
Call that "the plane" as a working name, can be separated into (vertical?) planes that require different weapons to be used - probably to be divided by distance (threats directly under the bunker, those further ahead, ones in the sky, distant long-range snipes, etc.)
Example: throw grenades/activate traps close up, automatic weapons for close-mid range, precision weapons for large distance, wide-area weapons for flying targets, more firepower for large targets. Switching between weapons should be fast, almost as if to perform combos.
New weapons and gameplay elements provided over time to increase complexity.
Possible Infitie Mode if the gameplay turns out good enough.

# The bunker part: #
The bunker works as the walkable/interactable Main Menu - picking between game modes, chapters/levels, options, exit, whatever else gets implemented.

## Setting: ##
Consider The Usual. Allows for sci-fi concepts and weapons, the bunker is plausible, plenty of enemy ideas to be included, both large and small scale depending on the location. Overarching plot can be included.
Otherwise, think something World War or Cold War adjacent. Plenty points of reference there. Modern Wolfenstein games?
